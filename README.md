Overview
========

Mininet-Sec is an emulation platform for studying and experimenting with cybersecurity in programmable networks. 
It allows rapid prototyping of cybersecurity scenarios, attack simulation, and testing offensive security tools
in an isolated and secure environment. The availability of specialized resources, along with support for 
network programmability, enables fast, effective and skilled development of security solutions. Mininet-Sec can
be used in a variety of scenarios, including secure interdomain routing, DDoS attacks, and network security 
teaching, interactive development, testing, etc..

The main goals/contributions/features for Mininet-Sec are:

- Easily deploy network scenarios for experimentation with cybersecurity (i.e., custom topologies, common network services, common cybersecurity tools and components)
- Topology visualization: mininet-sec comes with a Dash web app which allows topology visualization, command execution (terminal shell over web), addition/removal of switches, links, hosts, etc. 
- Enriched node library: Mininet-Sec is shipped with additional node types for Firewall, Software TAP, P4 Switches, etc, which helps provisioning diverse scenarios.

Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

There are two ways of running Mininet-Sec: 1) using Docker; 2) installing from source. The easiest way of running Mininet-Sec is via Docker containers:
```
docker pull hackinsdn/mininet-sec
docker run --rm -it --privileged -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules hackinsdn/mininet-sec /bin/bash
```

With the commands above you will instantiate and attach to Mininet-Sec's docker container. Privileged mode is required to be able to create network interfaces, namespaces, etc. The /lib/modules volume is needed to load openvswitch kernel module if needed (OpenFlow switch). There are other ways of running Mininet-Sec container, please refer to the entrypoint help to get more use cases: `docker run --rm hackinsdn/mininet-sec --help`

If you prefer to install from source, please continue reading. Otherwise, you can jump into the "Using Mininet-Sec" section.

Mininet-Sec can be easily installed on Debian and Ubuntu system. Other Linux distributions can also be used with some adjusments on the commands below or some level of manual effort.

In general, the main requirements for Mininet-Sec are:

- A Linux kernel compiled with network namespace support enabled
- A software switch such as Open vSwitch (recommended) or the Linux bridge
- Python3, bash, ping, iptables, hping3, hydra, etc
- Root privileges (required for network device access)

The following steps were executed in a Debian 12 system:

1. Install basic requirements (root privileges required):
```
apt-get update
apt-get install iputils-ping net-tools tcpdump x11-xserver-utils xterm iperf socat telnet tmux git iptables-persistent bridge-utils nmap hping3 mininet iperf3 hydra iproute2 python3-pip libpq-dev openvswitch-testcontroller curl d-itg
```

When asked to save current IPv4/IPv6 rules, you can answer *no*. When asked to start Iperf3 as a daemon automatically, you can also answer *no*.

2. Install Mininet-Sec (root privileges required):

```
git clone https://github.com/mininet-sec/mininet-sec
cd mininet-sec
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages .
service openvswitch-switch start
```

*Note*: the parameter `--break-system-packages` was used above to simplify the installation of Mininet-Sec, however a best approach would be to setup a virtual environment and install mininet-sec over there.

*Note2:* just after installing Mininet-Sec, the commands above start the OpenVSwitch daemon, just to make sure OVS is running for the examples below.


Using Mininet-Sec
-----------------

After the installation (or docker container instantiation), execute Mininet-sec with the following commands:

- Example 01: basic execution to make sure the installation was successfull (root privileges required):
```
mnsec --switch lxbr --topo=linear,3 --apps h1:ssh:port=22,h1:http:port=80,h3:smtp,h3:imap --test nmap,h1,10.0.0.0/24
```

The execution above should take a couple of seconds, and all output will be displayed at the end (be patiant). After finishing with nmap scan, Mininet-Sec will report the results and close.

- Example 02: using Mininet-Sec in interactive mode and standard topologies (root privileges required):

```
mnsec --topo linear,3 --apps h1:ssh:port=22,h1:http:port=80,h2:ldap,h3:smtp,h3:imap,h3:pop3
```

After executing the command above, you should see a prompt saying: `mininet-sec>`. From that prompt you can run commands just like mininet:

```
mininet-sec> h1 nmap 10.0.0.3
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-06 08:47 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.3
Host is up (0.016s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
25/tcp  open  smtp
110/tcp open  pop3
143/tcp open  imap
MAC Address: 8A:88:D8:C4:D4:4F (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.52 seconds
mininet-sec> exit
```

On the commands above we leveraged the OVS Test Controller just to make sure OpenFlow tables on the switch gets properly populated (ideally you should run a more robust SDN Controller, such as Kytos-ng, Faucet, OpenDayLight, ONOS, etc). If you want to use a custom controller, just add the option `--controller=remote,ip=x.y.z.w` to the mnsec command (just like Mininet).

- Example 03: using a custom topology via Python API - for this example we will use two terminal windows (root privileges required):

```
python3 examples/firewall.py
```

After running the command above, you should see again the Mininet-Sec prompt `mininet-sec>`. For the purpose of this example, please open a new terminal window to run the commands below (root privileges required):

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/top-passwords-shortlist.txt
mnsecx o1 hydra -L top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P top-usernames-shortlist.txt imap://10.0.0.2/LOGIN
```

The command above leverages `mnsecx` utility to run a command inside the host `o1`, which facilitate the command execution on Mininet-Sec hosts outside the prompt. The example above can be ilustrated with the following image:

![example03](./examples/example03.png)

You can also open your internet browser app and point to Mininet-Sec web UI via http://127.0.0.1:8050/ and you should see something similar to:

![example03-web](./examples/example03-web.png)

## Packet Capture

You can visualize packets on the link similar to what we have in Wireshark/Edgeshark (thanks to webshark and sharkd). In order to have Packet Capture working fine, you will need:

- Provide the packet capture directory (where pcap files will be saved). That can be done with the command line argument `--capture_dir` or when instantiating Mininet\_sec with parameter `captureDir` (see examples/firewall.py). You can also configure the maximum file size for pcap files with the `--capture_file_size` (or `captureFileSize` on Mininet\_sec python class) -- defaults to 10M.

- You need to have webshark running. Example:
```
docker run -d --name webshark -e CAPTURES_PATH=/captures/ -e SHARKD_SOCKET=/home/node/sharkd.sock -p 8085:8085 -v /home/italo/tmp/mnsec:/captures hackinsdn/webshark
```

- TODO: we need to find a way to redirect requests to the proper container from Mininet-Sec
